## 1，自我介绍，你的履历，工作过的公司，主要做什么，各有什么收获，各有什么好的地方和不好的地方，选择的原因和离开的原因
I have four working experiences，
<br/>
the first one is the internship in Microsoft China during my master's degree，in summer holiday in 2012. I have a deep impression about that, it's my first job, and that year is London Olympic Games, my work is mainly about optimizing the search result of the Olympic events, and developed some data automation tools for bing search engine. I have learned a lot during that period, met a lot of talented engineers, work with them, solve problem together, I just feel very fresh and interesting. 
I didn't stay because I'm not very interested in search engine.

My second job in in tencent, this is a very great company, they have a lot of successful products like qq, wechat. This is my first job after graduation. I join the tencent news team as a mobile software engineer. Tencent News is also a very successful product, its daily active users exceeds thirty millions three years ago. and now exceeds eighty million. My main job is news page rendering, advertising, and some features like comment, messages and so on. I benefit a lot from it, knowing how to make a successful product. And you have to be responsible for your product, because any one of your mistakes will affect a lot of users, it may cause great losses to the company. I left tencent because the product was mature enough, and there was no big challenge in technology.

My third job is in Xiaomi, it was originally a start-up company making mobile phones, and later extended to the mobile phone software, intelligent hardware and so on. I was mainly involved in developing the intelligent hardware platforms, build infrastructure framework, developed a series of communication protocols, so that make everything connected, devices can access the Internet, report data to the server while receive instruction from server, mobile phone or other devices. I also have to provide technical support for all the devices running in our platform. During the three years in xiaomi, my technical ability has greatly improved, especially on mobile software architecture and building complex system. I left Xiaomi because I saw the potential of artificial intelligence, but Xiaomi in this area is not very strong.

At present I am working in a start-up company which mainly engaged in artificial intelligence, It has two parts, one part is smart home and 
another part is smart driving。I am a software engineer responsible for smart home related products. Currenty we are exploring the next generation of interaction technology between people and machine, we can use voice, gestures and even facial expression to control the TV, air conditioner and so on, completely out of mobile phone, to fully use artificial intelligence To bring more convenience to our lives.Because we are exploring, we will put forward a variety of ideas, and quickly develop a demo, let everyone use it, and then look at which one is better.

In general, I hope to do some exciting and challenging things, which can bring great convenience for our lives, like artificial intelligent, VR and so on. I love coding, in the future I will further improve my technology stack, and more consideration of product level issues, create greater value for my group. At the same time, I will be more active participating some excellent open source projects, do some technical sharing, make the world more open.

## 6，你和同事有分歧，如何处理的
First we have to confirm that we have the same target, the difference is perspective and method, if it doesn't matter, I can compromise so that we can reach an agreement as soon as possible to promote the project. If it matters, then we need more senior experts and superiors participate for evaluation. If other people don't agree with me, I'll prove it, do experiment and provide the data.

## 7，你做过的失败的项目, 有什么收获
Once briefly participated in a project-Xiaomi Messenger, eventually failed. But I think I still benefit a lot from it. I had learned mobile messenger related technology, improved problem solving skills, cooperate with team member. we can summarize to avoid the same problems in the future.

## 8，你的优点和缺点
My advantage is strong self motivated, initiative to undertake work and try my best to do well. I like challenges,  I like learn new things. I like solve problems.

I'm a little bit introverted. I don't have too much words out of work. I'm not good at find topics when chatting with people, unless they talk about technology or science. But I am very willing to make friends, and now I am trying to change myself, for example, to pay more attention to the things besides technology, like sports,history, military, and be more active participating in some activities.

## 9，你喜欢什么样的工作，讨厌什么样的工作
I don't like the work with no challenge, repetitive。

## 10，你业余时间喜欢做什么
In my spare time, I usually go to the gym, or swimming, read books, about history.

## 11，你觉得你和3年前比有什么不一样，你希望3年后的你是什么样的
I'm more confident. On the one hand, I have stronger ability. I can do many things I couldn't do before, and solve problems that I couldn't solve before. On the other hand, I can see more clearly about what to do in the future. 

I'm more cautious，because the stronger the ability, the greater the responsibility. Any of my mistakes will cost more than before, so I need to be more careful and work harder to improve myself.

I hope that 3 years later I will be a good husband and a good father. Create greater value in a more critical position of the company. Find more pleasure in life, and make more friends.
